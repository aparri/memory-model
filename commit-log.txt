tools: Automate memory-barriers.txt; provide Linux-kernel memory model

There is some reason to believe that Documentation/memory-barriers.txt
could use some help, and a major purpose of this patch is to provide
that help in the form of a design-time tool that can produce all valid
executions of a small fragment of concurrent Linux-kernel code, which is
called a "litmus test".  This tool's functionality is roughly similar to
a full state-space search.  Please note that this is a design-time tool,
not useful for regression testing.  However, we hope that the underlying
Linux-kernel memory model will be incorporated into other tools capable
of analyzing large bodies of code for regression-testing purposes.

The main tool is herd7, together with the linux-kernel.bell,
linux-kernel.cat, linux-kernel.cfg, linux-kernel.def, and lock.cat files
added by this patch.  The herd7 executable takes the other files as input,
and all of these files collectively define the Linux-kernel memory memory
model.  A brief description of each of these other files is provided in
the README file.  Please note that herd7 is not part of this submission,
but is freely available from http://diy.inria.fr/sources/index.html.

A second tool is klitmus7, which converts litmus tests to loadable
kernel modules for direct testing.  As with herd7, the klitmus7
code is freely available from http://diy.inria.fr/sources/index.html.

Of course, litmus tests are not always the best way to fully understand a
memory model, so this patch also includes Documentation/explanation.txt,
which describes the memory model in detail.  In addition,
Documentation/recipes.txt provides example known-good and known-bad use
cases for those who prefer working by example.

This patch also includes a few sample litmus tests, and a great many
more litmus tests are available at https://github.com/paulmckrcu/litmus.
