			=========================
			LINUX KERNEL MEMORY MODEL
			=========================

============
INTRODUCTION
============

The memory model of the Linux kernel written in the "cat" language and
executable by the "herd7" simulator.

REQUIREMENTS
============

  https://github.com/herd/herdtools7

See "herdtools7/INSTALL.md" for installation instructions.

Alternatively, Abhishek Bhardwaj has kindly provided a Docker image
of these tools at "abhishek40/memory-model".  Abhishek suggests the
following commands to install and use this image:

- Users should install Docker for their distribution.
- docker run -itd abhishek40/memory-model
- docker attach <id-emitted-from-the-previous-command>

Gentoo users might wish to make use of Patrick McLean's package:

===========
BASIC USAGE
===========

  $ herd7 -conf linux-kernel.cfg [option(s)] <litmus_test(s)>

For example, to run MP+poonceonces.litmus:

  $ herd7 -conf linux-kernel.cfg litmus-tests/MP+poonceonces.litmus

For another example, to run against the hardware model:

  $ herd7 -conf linux-kernel.cfg -cat linux-kernel-hardware.cat litmus-tests/MP+poonceonces.litmus

This litmus test gives the same result for both models, so both produce
similar output:

  Test MP+poonceonces Allowed
  States 4
  1:r0=0; 1:r1=0;
  1:r0=0; 1:r1=1;
  1:r0=1; 1:r1=0;
  1:r0=1; 1:r1=1;
  Ok
  Witnesses
  Positive: 1 Negative: 3
  Condition exists (1:r0=1 /\ 1:r1=0)
  Observation MP+poonceonces Sometimes 1 3
  Time MP+poonceonces 0.01
  Hash=791a930f10ec3578ffdda7bf43deeb22

The "Positive: 1 Negative: 3" and the "Sometimes 1 3" each indicate that
this litmus test's "exists" clause can be satisfied.

See "herdtools7/doc/" for more information.

DESCRIPTION
===========


Documentation
	Directory that includes "explanation.txt" which describes
	the memory model in detail, "recipes.txt" which lists common
	memory-ordering patterns, and "references.txt" which provides
	background reading.

linux-kernel.bell
	Defines the semantics of instructions, including memory
	references, memory barriers, atomic read-modify-write operations,
	locking, and RCU.

	More formally, this file (1) lists the subtypes of the various
	event types used by the memory model and (2) performs RCU
	read-side critical section nesting analysis.

linux-kernel.cat
	Specifies what reorderings are forbidden by memory references,
	memory barriers, atomic read-modify-write operations, and RCU.

	More formally, this file specifies what executions are forbidden
	by the memory model.  Allowed executions are those which
	satisfy the model's "coherence", "atomic", "happens-before",
	"propagation", and "rcu" axioms, which are defined in the file.

linux-kernel.cfg
	Convenience file that gathers the common-case herd7 command-line
	arguments.

linux-kernel.def
	Maps from C-like syntax to herd7's internal litmus-test
	instruction-set architecture.

litmus-tests
	Directory containing a few representative litmus tests.
	A great deal more litmus tests are available at
	https://github.com/paulmckrcu/litmus.

lock.cat
	Specifies the reorderings that are forbidden by locking.

	More formally, this file defines a performance-enhanced scheme
	for generation of the possible reads-from and coherence order
	relations on the locking primitives.
